    "## Dimensionally Extended Nine-Intersection Model (DE-9IM)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Author:** Christian Strobl, German Remote Sensing Data Center (DFD), German Aerospace Center (DLR)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Synonyms\n",
    "Dimensionally Extended Nine-Intersection Model (DE-9IM), Nine-Intersection Model (9IM), Four-Intersection Model (4IM), Egenhofer Operators, Clementini Operators; Topological Operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition\n",
    "The Dimensionally Extended Nine-Intersection Model (DE-9IM) or Clementini-Matrix is specified by the OGC \"Simple Features for SQL\" specification for computing the spatial relationships between geometries. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is based on the Nine-Intersection Model (9IM) or Egenhofer-Matrix, which is an extension of the Four-Intersection Model (4IM). The DE-9IM considers the two objects' interiors, boundaries, and exteriors and analyzes the intersections of these nine parts for their relationships. The model records the maximum dimension (-1, 0, 1, or 2) of the intersection geometries, where -1 corresponds to no intersection (empty set).\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary spatial relationships described by the DE-9IM are:\n",
    "* Equals\n",
    "* Disjoint\n",
    "* Intersects\n",
    "* Touches\n",
    "* Crosses\n",
    "* Within\n",
    "* Contains\n",
    "* Overlaps\n",
    "\n",
    "## Main Text\n",
    "There are three common approaches for describing topological relationships between geodata, each based on an intersection matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Four-Intersection Model (4IM)\n",
    "The 4IM considers only the interior and the boundary of two objects. It creates a 2x2 matrix that describes whether the intersections between the interiors and boundaries of objects A and B are empty (0) or non-empty (1).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nine-Intersection Model (9IM)\n",
    "The 9IM extends the 4IM by including the exterior of the objects. This results in a 3x3 matrix. Like the 4IM, it traditionally uses boolean values (empty or non-empty) to describe the intersections of Interior (I), Boundary (B), and Exterior (E).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dimensionally Extended Nine-Intersection Model (DE-9IM)\n",
    "The DE-9IM further refines the 9IM by recording the **dimension** of the intersection rather than just a boolean state.\n",
    "\n",
    "The intersection of any two parts results in a set of points. The value in the DE-9IM matrix is the maximum dimension of this point set:\n",
    "* **-1**: The intersection is empty ($\\emptyset$).\n",
    "* **0**: The intersection contains only points (0-dimensional).\n",
    "* **1**: The intersection contains lines (1-dimensional).\n",
    "* **2**: The intersection contains polygons/areas (2-dimensional).\n",
    "\n",
    "The matrix is structured as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "| | Interior(B) | Boundary(B) | Exterior(B) |\n",
    "| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n",
    "| **Interior(A)** | dim(I(A)∩I(B)) | dim(I(A)∩B(B)) | dim(I(A)∩E(B)) |\n",
    "| **Boundary(A)** | dim(B(A)∩I(B)) | dim(B(A)∩B(B)) | dim(B(A)∩E(B)) |\n",
    "| **Exterior(A)** | dim(E(A)∩I(B)) | dim(E(A)∩B(B)) | dim(E(A)∩E(B)) |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Geometric Operators and Predicates\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disjoint\n",
    "$A \\cap B = \\emptyset$\n",
    "The interiors and boundaries of the two geometries do not intersect at all.\n",
    "* Pattern: `FF*FF****`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intersects\n",
    "$A \\cap B \\neq \\emptyset$\n",
    "The complement of Disjoint. The geometries share at least one point.\n",
    "* Pattern: `T********` or `*T*******` or `***T*****` or `****T****`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Touches\n",
    "$A \\cap B \\neq \\emptyset$, but $Interior(A) \\cap Interior(B) = \\emptyset$.\n",
    "The geometries have at least one point in common, but their interiors do not overlap. This applies to Area/Area, Line/Line, Line/Area, and Point/Area, but not Point/Point.\n",
    "* Pattern: `FT*******` or `F**T*****` or `F***T****`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Crosses\n",
    "The geometries share some but not all interior points, and the dimension of the intersection is less than the maximum dimension of the two geometries.\n",
    "* Pattern: `T*T******` (for Line/Area) or `0********` (for Line/Line)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Within\n",
    "The geometry A lies entirely within the interior of B.\n",
    "* Pattern: `T*F**F***`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Contains\n",
    "The inverse of Within. Geometry B is within Geometry A.\n",
    "* Pattern: `T*****FF*`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overlaps\n",
    "The geometries share some but not all points in common, and the intersection has the same dimension as the geometries themselves.\n",
    "* Pattern: `T*T***T**` (for Area/Area) or `1*T***T**` (for Line/Line)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Equals\n",
    "The two geometries are topologically equal; they occupy the same space.\n",
    "* Pattern: `T*F**FFF*`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "The DE-9IM is a powerful mathematical framework that allows GIS systems to query spatial relationships between complex objects rigorously. By using a 3x3 matrix of dimensions, it provides a unique \"fingerprint\" for every possible topological configuration between two geometric features."
