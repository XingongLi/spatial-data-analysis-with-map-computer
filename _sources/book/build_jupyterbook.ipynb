    "# Write a book using Jupyter-Book on Github\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "[Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/stable/) is a tool to create computational narratives (i.e., books) that are accessible, reusable, reproducible, and interactive. JB is built on the [MyST Markdonw Document ENgine (mystmd)](https://jupyterbook.org/stable/community/ecosystem/), which is a next generation document engine that is data-driven, computation-centric, and flexible. JB is a lightweight for mystmd.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can write an online book using JB and publish it on Github using the [jupyter-book-demo template](https://github.com/giswqs/jupyter-book-demo) and YouTube video [Open Publishing in Action: Creating Interactive Books with Jupyter Book and MyST Markdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2d1Kw1xSVY) (published on 10/23/2025) which is part of the [Open Publishing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxoEM5x4EfQ&list=PLAxJ4-o7ZoPcudAyC050UOrSDr3v9leUP&index=2) part of  the [UTK Open Science Workshop](https://openscience.gishub.org/open-publishing/) held in the spring of 2025. The template sets up the project structure and configures the GitHub workflow to speed up the publishing process. This document is based on the YouTube video and the template project for reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note there is an earlier version of the effort, the [cookiecutter-jupyter-book](https://github.com/giswqs/cookiecutter-jupyter-book) which is based on the [cookiecutter-jupyter-book](https://github.com/executablebooks/cookiecutter-jupyter-book).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create a book repository on GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "First we need to create a GitHub repository for the book. Here we assume that we have a GitHub account and we can use the [jupyter-book-demo template GitHub project](https://github.com/giswqs/jupyter-book-demo) to create our own book project.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use the \"Use this template\\Create a new repository\" to create a new project on our GitHub repository\n",
    "* Give a name to the book repository and simple description and then create the repository\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Jupyter-Book 2.x has some issues when building the book using command \"uv run jupyter-book build .\". So we will edit the file directly on GitHub to specify the version of 1.0.4 instead of 2.x for the package (i.e., jupyter-book==1.0.4). This is NOT necessary when those issues are addressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create a special branch (with the name \"gh-pages\") for the book repository to publish the book as [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) (basically a web site on github.io to host your personal, organization, or project pages from a GitHub repository). This is done by click on \"main\" and type in \"gh-pages\" and create the gh-pages branch from main. This also initiate the process (i.e., \"Initial commit\") of building the web site.\n",
    "* The initial commit may encounter a permission error which can be resolved by changing \"Settings\\Actions\\General\\Workflow permissions\" to \"Read and write permission and rerun the job.\n",
    "* Go to \"Settings\\Pages\" to view the book web site. You can also link the site to a custom domain here.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Set up a local environment\n",
    "\n",
    "We will have a copy of the repository on local machine so that we can write the book locally and update it on the GitHub. We can use the git tool to clone a repository. In CMD,  navigate to your local folder and run the following command with your book repository URL:\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Navigate to your project directory\n",
    "cd /path/to/your/project\n",
    "\n",
    "# clone the repository\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/XingongLi/spatial-data-analysis-with-map-compute.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use VSC and Python to edit and write the book. We need to build a local Python environment for the book. Here we will use the latest uv tool to create and manage python environment. Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#installing-uv) to install uv on your machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once uv is installed, you can create and activate a new environment with the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Navigate to your project directory\n",
    "cd /path/to/your/project\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a virtual environment\n",
    "uv venv --python 3.12\n",
    "\n",
    "# Activate the environment (varies by OS)\n",
    ".venv\\Scripts\\activate\n",
    "\n",
    "# Install all the dependence\n",
    "uv pip install pip\n",
    "uv pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Write and edit the book\n",
    "\n",
    "We can built the book by running command, and The local book can be opened under \"_build\\html\\index.html\".\n",
    "```\n",
    "uv run jupyter-book build .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can open the book project in VSC, add or change contents, and push the changes to to book web site on GitHub Pages in VSC. The template provides the workflow to automate the process."
