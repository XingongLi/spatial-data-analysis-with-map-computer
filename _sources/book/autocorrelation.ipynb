    "Characterize overall attribute pattern in space\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analyze and Map Spatial Variations\n",
    "* Spatial variation of the location of objects/events:\n",
    "    * Spatial descriptive statistics (mean center, standard deviation ellipse).\n",
    "    * Point pattern analysis (Randomness and cluster mapping).\n",
    "* Spatial variation of attributes associated with objects/events:\n",
    "    * Spatial autocorrelation (Moran's I).\n",
    "* Spatial variation of relationships:\n",
    "    * How relationships vary in space.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Characterize Attribute Spatial Pattern\n",
    "* Location randomness (Point patterns): Quadrat analysis and Nearest neighbor distance.\n",
    "* Attribute randomness (Spatial autocorrelation):\n",
    "    * How different is an observed attribute pattern from a random distribution?\n",
    "    * Positive spatial autocorrelation: Similar values cluster together.\n",
    "    * Negative spatial autocorrelation: Dissimilar values cluster together (checkerboard).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## First Law of Geography\n",
    "* Waldo Tobler (1970): \"Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things.\"\n",
    "* Spatial autocorrelation is a quantification of this law.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Moran’s I\n",
    "* The most common measure of spatial autocorrelation.\n",
    "* Compares the attribute value at each location with the values at its neighboring locations.\n",
    "* Formula components:\n",
    "    * $z_i$: Deviation of an attribute for feature $i$ from its mean ($x_i - \\bar{x}$).\n",
    "    * $w_{i,j}$: Spatial weight between feature $i$ and $j$ (neighborhood definition).\n",
    "    * $S_0$: Aggregate of all spatial weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interpreting Moran’s I\n",
    "* Range is generally between -1.0 and +1.0.\n",
    "* Positive value: Clustered pattern (Positive autocorrelation).\n",
    "* Zero: Random pattern.\n",
    "* Negative value: Dispersed/Checkerboard pattern (Negative autocorrelation).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Spatial Weights ($w_{i,j}$)\n",
    "* Define the neighborhood relationship for the autocorrelation calculation.\n",
    "* Binary weights: 1 if $j$ is a neighbor of $i$, 0 otherwise.\n",
    "* Distance-based weights: $1/d$ or $1/d^2$ (inverse distance).\n",
    "* Adjacency-based:\n",
    "    * Rook's Case: Share an edge.\n",
    "    * Queen's Case: Share an edge or a corner.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Significance Testing\n",
    "* Null Hypothesis: The attribute being analyzed is randomly distributed among the features in the study area.\n",
    "* Z-score and p-value are used to determine if the observed Moran's I index is statistically significant.\n",
    "* If p < 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis of randomness.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Spatial Lag\n",
    "* The \"spatial lag\" of a variable is the weighted average of the values of its neighbors.\n",
    "* $Lag(x_i) = \\sum (w_{i,j} \\times x_j)$\n",
    "* Moran's I can be seen as the correlation between a variable and its spatial lag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Correlograms\n",
    "* A plot of spatial autocorrelation (Moran’s I) against different distance \"lags\" (neighborhood sizes).\n",
    "* Typically, autocorrelation is highest at short distances and decreases as distance increases.\n",
    "* The point where it hits zero or stays flat indicates the \"range\" of spatial influence.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Semivariance as a Measure of Difference\n",
    "* While Moran's I measures similarity, semivariance measures difference.\n",
    "* Computed from sample pairs at a certain distance $h$ (the lag).\n",
    "* $\\gamma(h) = \\frac{1}{2N(h)} \\sum [z(x_i) - z(x_i + h)]^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Variogram (or Semivariogram)\n",
    "* A plot of semivariance versus distance (lag).\n",
    "* Nugget: Measurement error or micro-scale variation at zero distance.\n",
    "* Sill: The point where the variance flattens out.\n",
    "* Range: The distance at which locations are no longer spatially autocorrelated.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "* Spatial autocorrelation helps distinguish between meaningful spatial patterns and random noise.\n",
    "* Moran's I focuses on global similarity across a map.\n",
    "* Variograms focus on the scale and distance of spatial dependence, often used as a precursor to spatial interpolation."
