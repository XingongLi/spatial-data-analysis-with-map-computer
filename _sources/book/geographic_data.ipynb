    "## Mapping and Measurement Frameworks\n",
    "* Geospatial data consists of location, attribute, and time components\n",
    "    * All three components cannot be measured simultaneously\n",
    "* Measurement frameworks provide rules for ignoring or controlling some components to measure one\n",
    "    * One component must be fixed (irrelevant)\n",
    "    * Another component serves as control (imposes discrete divisions)\n",
    "* Discrete divisions constrain the resolution and accuracy of the measurement\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Mapping Measurement Frameworks\n",
    "* Time is fixed: Measured at a specific point in time or during a period\n",
    "* Location as control: Space is divided into cells, polygons, or administrative boundaries\n",
    "    * Attributes are then measured for these divisions\n",
    "* Attribute as control: Specific attributes (e.g., land cover types or elevations) are chosen\n",
    "    * Locations are then measured for these attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mapping Surface Elevation—Raster Map\n",
    "* Location serves as the control\n",

    "| ID | Location/Geometry | Elevation |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| 1 | (x1,y1), (x2,y2) … (xn, yn) | 100 |\n",

    "* Relation between location and attribute: $Attribute = f(location)$\n",
    "* Domain: Location on Earth\n",
    "* Codomain: Any measured attributes/variables\n",
    "* Map is a stored function because location-value relations usually lack mathematical formulas\n",
    "\n",
    "## Raster Map\n",
    "* Matrix serves as a stored function\n",
    "    * Each cell is located by its row and column\n",
    "* Each cell represents a location-value relation\n",
    "* Usually, the upper-left corner cell is georeferenced; other locations are derived\n",
    "\n",
    "## Zone Raster Map\n",
    "* Cells with the same value form a \"zone\"\n",
    "* The zone serves as the mapping unit location\n",

    "* Population interpolation: Uses areal interpolation\n",
    "* Attribute types:\n",
    "    * Intensive: Magnitude independent of size (e.g., density)\n",
    "    * Extensive: Magnitude is additive (e.g., mass, population)\n",
    "* Spatially intensive: Value is the same everywhere within a mapping unit\n",
    "* Spatially extensive: Value changes if the mapping unit is modified\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multi-valued Vector Map\n",
    "* Results from combining multiple single-valued maps (e.g., Soil + Land Cover)\n",
