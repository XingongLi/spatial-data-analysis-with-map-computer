    "* Neighborhood Relation Operations\n",
    "* Spatial Connectivity Analysis\n",
    "* Distance Analysis\n",

    "## Map Compute Framework\n",
    "* Three kinds of analysis/mapping units (MUs) in maps:\n",
    "    * Cells, raster zones, and features\n",
    "* Four kinds of operations:\n",
    "    * Local, focal, and global operations based on the spatial scope of the neighborhood\n",
    "    * Neighborhood relation operations\n",

    "| Mapping Units | Neighborhood Relation: Local | Neighborhood Relation: Focal | Neighborhood Relation: Global |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",

    "## Neighborhood Relation Operations\n",
    "* Local, focal, and global operations manipulate the data within the neighborhood associated with a focus MU.\n",
    "* Neighborhood relation operations characterize all the neighborhoods associated with the MUs on a map.\n",
    "* Example: **NbrLocation** represents the location covered by all the neighborhoods of a set of features (points, lines, or polygons).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Siren Population Coverage Analysis (Vector Data Model)\n",
    "* Circle neighborhood is created for each siren point.\n",
    "* Location covered by all neighborhoods is found by combining all circle neighborhoods into a multi-part coverage polygon.\n",
    "* This is a neighborhood relation operation (NbrLocation).\n",
    "* Local sum is performed using combined buffers as the mapping unit.\n",
    "* Effective neighbors are found by intersecting the coverage polygon with census blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## NbrLocation with Raster Distance Neighborhoods\n",
    "* The operation can be performed with raster data using distance-based neighborhoods.\n",
    "* Example: A neighborhood defined by distance d <= 3 cell units.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Buffer Tool as a Neighborhood Relation Operation\n",
    "* The Buffer tool in GIS is a neighborhood relation operation where the buffer is the neighborhood of each feature.\n",
    "* It creates an output map as a single multi-part polygon representing the location covered by at least one neighborhood.\n",
    "* Alternatively, it can create a set of isolated polygons, each with a unique ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "## NbrLocationFrequency Operation\n",
    "* For features: Calculates the frequency of a location that belongs to overlapping neighborhoods.\n",
    "* ArcGIS Pro Tool: \"Count Overlapping Features\" generates planarized overlapping features with a count written to the output.\n",
    "* For cells: A value raster specifies MUs.\n",
    "    * Neighborhoods can include \"+\", 3x3 window, zonal, or watershed neighborhoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Degree of Neighborhood Overlapping (NbrOverlapDegree)\n",
    "* Quantifies the degree of neighborhood overlapping.\n",
    "* For 2 neighborhoods: (Area of Intersection) / (Area of Union), resulting in a value between 0 and 1.\n",
    "* For more than 2 neighborhoods: (Frequency weighted area of locations with frequency >=2) / (Area of locations with frequency >=1).\n",
    "* Typical values:\n",
    "    * Local neighborhoods: 0 (no overlap).\n",
    "    * Focal neighborhoods (3x3 window): approximately 0.27.\n",
    "    * Zonal neighborhoods: example value of 0.52.\n",
    "    * Global neighborhoods: always 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "## MU Graph Through Neighborhoods (NbrGraph)\n",
    "* An NbrGraph operation forms a mapping unit spatial graph through MU neighborhoods.\n",
    "* A neighborhood defines a relationship where a MU is \"connected\" to its neighbors, forming a link.\n",
    "* Interactions can occur:\n",
    "    * When a MU is in another MU's neighborhood.\n",
    "    * When a MU's neighborhood co-locates with the neighborhood of another MU (e.g., buffers overlap).\n",
    "* MUs act as nodes with geographical locations, and links among MUs have weights characterizing their relation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Spatial Connectivity Analysis\n",
    "* Connectivity analysis identifies groups of connected MUs, known as sub-graphs or components.\n",
    "* MU graphs can be formed by various neighborhoods:\n",
    "    * Spatial adjacency (4- or 8-connectivity).\n",
    "    * Distance-based neighborhoods.\n",
    "    * Watershed or Viewshed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Spatial Adjacency as Neighborhood\n",
    "* A cell is spatially adjacent to its immediate neighbors.\n",
    "* 4-adjacency (\"+\" neighborhood): Cells sharing an edge.\n",
    "* 8-adjacency (3x3 window neighborhood): Cells sharing an edge or a point.\n",
    "* Adjacency usually exists between cells with the same value (e.g., foreground vs. background).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Identifying Connected Regions (RegionGroup)\n",
    "* RegionGroup identifies and groups connected cells with the same value into regions.\n",
    "* A zone consists of all cells with the same value.\n",
    "* A region (or component) consists of cells that have the same value AND are spatially connected.\n",
    "* Each unique region is assigned a unique ID number.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Connectivity with Distance-Based Neighborhoods\n",
    "* Connectivity can be defined by distance rather than just adjacency.\n",
    "* A 1-cell radius circle is equivalent to 4-adjacency.\n",
    "* A square root of 2 cell size radius is equivalent to 8-adjacency.\n",
    "* Cells may be connected even if not immediately adjacent, depending on the neighborhood radius used.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Nearest Neighbor Connectivity for Features\n",
    "* The nearest point can be defined as the neighborhood of a point.\n",
    "* This forms a directed graph since nearness is not always symmetric.\n",
    "* Sub-graph analysis then groups these points, lines, or polygons based on these connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Euclidean Distance and Direction\n",
    "* Euclidean Distance: Calculates the straight-line distance to the nearest source.\n",
    "* Euclidean Direction: Calculates the direction (in degrees) to the nearest source.\n",
    "* These are treated as Global Operations within the framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cost Distance Analysis\n",
    "* Movement cost varies across a friction surface.\n",
    "* Accumulated Cost Surface: A global operation determining the minimum cost to reach a source.\n",
    "* Identify the least-cost path based on the accumulated surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Proximity Regions (Thiessen Polygons)\n",
    "* A neighborhood relation operation where the study area is divided into regions based on the nearest source feature.\n",
    "* Boundaries are the perpendicular bisectors of the lines connecting neighboring source points.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Identity of the Nearest Source Zone\n",
    "* Every cell receives the ID of the nearest source feature.\n",
    "* This is also referred to as \"Allocation\" in GIS software.\n",
    "* In this operation, cells are the mapping units and the neighborhood is the nearest source zone."
