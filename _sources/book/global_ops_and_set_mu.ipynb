    "# Global Operations, Effective Neighborhoods, and Analysis MUs\n",
    "\n",
    "## Topics\n",
    "* Global neighborhood and operation\n",
    "* Effective neighborhood and neighbor\n",
    "* Setting output/analysis mapping unit\n",
    "\n",
    "## Global Neighborhoods\n",
    "* A local neighborhood is the focus MU itself; each neighborhood is unique and there is no overlap in space.\n",
    "* A focal neighborhood goes beyond the focus MU; neighborhoods may overlap in space.\n",
    "* Global neighborhood:\n",
    "    * All MUs have the same neighborhood.\n",
    "    * Includes all the MUs in the map (or otherwise specified extent).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Global Operations\n",
    "* Operations that characterize the entire map.\n",
    "* Compute a new map where the value for each MU is a function of all values on the input map(s).\n",
    "* Global Statistics: GlobalMin, GlobalMax, GlobalMean, GlobalStandardDeviation.\n",
    "* $Value_{new} = f(Values_{global})$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Euclidean Distance as a Global Operation\n",
    "* Euclidean distance is a global operation because the distance to the nearest source depends on the locations of all source features across the entire map.\n",
    "* Every cell in the output raster receives a value representing the distance to the closest source.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Effective Neighborhood and Neighbors\n",
    "* A focal neighborhood can be very large (e.g., a large buffer or a large watershed).\n",
    "* Effective neighbors: The subset of neighbors that actually exist or contain data within the defined neighborhood.\n",
    "* In vector data, a neighborhood (like a circle) might overlap multiple census blocks; those blocks are the effective neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Characterizing Effective Neighborhoods\n",
    "* Characterize neighbor attribute(s) and geometry:\n",
    "    * LocalCount, LocalSum, LocalStats.\n",
    "    * Line length, polygon area.\n",
    "* Characterize neighbor location:\n",
    "    * Mean center (the \"center of gravity\" for the neighbors).\n",
    "* Characterize neighbor attribute(s) and location:\n",
    "    * Weighted mean center.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting Analysis/Output Mapping Units\n",
    "* How to define the MUs for the output map when performing an operation.\n",
    "* Usually, the output MUs are:\n",
    "    * Same as the input MUs (most local and focal operations).\n",
    "    * Defined by a specific layer (e.g., using census blocks as the analysis units for a point-in-polygon operation).\n",
    "    * Created by the intersection of multiple input maps (e.g., vector overlay).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Block Statistics in ArcGIS\n",
    "* Performs a neighborhood operation that computes an output where the value for each non-overlapping \"block\" is a function of the input.\n",
    "* In the Map Compute Framework, this is viewed as:\n",
    "    * Blocks = raster zones.\n",
    "    * LocalStatistics with blocks as MUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting Output MUs with Two Input Vector Maps\n",
    "* Vector overlay tools define output MUs based on geometric intersections:\n",
    "    * Intersect: Keeps only areas common to both.\n",
    "    * Identity: Keeps all areas of the first input, and only overlapping parts of the second.\n",
    "    * Union: Keeps all areas from both inputs.\n",
    "    * Symmetrical Difference: Keeps areas in either input, but not both.\n",
    "    * Erase: Removes areas of the input that overlap the erase features.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Point Statistics Tool in ArcGIS\n",
    "* The tool performs a neighborhood operation where the value for each output cell is a function of the input point features falling within a specified neighborhood.\n",
    "* This is a focal operation where the analysis unit is a cell, but the input data comes from point features.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary of Analysis Units\n",
    "* Choice of MU impacts the results (The Modifiable Areal Unit Problem - MAUP).\n",
    "* Local operations can involve a change in MUs (e.g., aggregating points into polygons).\n",
    "* Vector overlay is essentially a process of generating a new set of analysis MUs that inherit attributes from multiple sources."
