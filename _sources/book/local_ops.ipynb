    "## Map Compute Framework\n",
    "* Three kinds of analysis/mapping units (MUs) in maps\n",
    "    * Cells, raster zones, features\n",
    "* Four kinds of operations\n",
    "    * Local, focal, and global operations (based on spatial scope)\n",

    "## Topics\n",
    "* Local operations\n",
    "    * Cells and vector features as mapping units\n",
    "    * Output/analysis MU itself is and defines the neighborhood\n",
    "* Application examples\n",
    "    * NDWI and mNDWI\n",
    "    * Composite image\n",
    "    * Create rainfall map using elevation map\n",
    "\n",
    "## Local Operations\n",
    "* Compute a new map where the value for each MU on the output map is a function of one or more values at the same MU on the input map(s)\n",
    "* General form: $Value_{new} = f(Value_{in1}, Value_{in2}, ...)$\n",
    "* Output map MUs are the same as (or defined by) the input MUs\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Local Operations in Practice\n",
    "* Reclassify (e.g., fungus diffusion exercise)\n",
    "* Turn precipitation table into a map (using weather station points)\n",
    "* Map overlay (Intersect, Union, Erase, etc.)\n",
    "* Field calculator (Vector) / Raster calculator (Raster)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Local Operations\n",
    "* Local operations with one input map\n",
    "    * $Value_{new} = f(Value_{in})$\n",
    "* Local operations with multiple input maps\n",
    "    * $Value_{new} = f(Value_{in1}, Value_{in2}, ...)$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Local Operations: One Input Map\n",
    "* Arithmetic and logical operations\n",
    "    * $Map + 10$\n",
    "    * $Map > 100$ (Boolean output)\n",
    "* Reclassification\n",
    "    * Grouping values into new categories\n",
    "    * Example: Land cover types to \"Suitable/Unsuitable\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Local Operations: Multiple Input Maps\n",
    "* Cell-by-cell or feature-by-feature combination\n",
    "* Mathematical combinations\n",
    "    * $Map_A + Map_B$\n",
    "    * $(Map_{NIR} - Map_{Red}) / (Map_{NIR} + Map_{Red})$ (NDVI)\n",
    "* Overlay (Vertical Integration)\n",
    "\n",
    "## NDWI and mNDWI Example\n",
    "* Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI)\n",
    "    * $NDWI = (Green - NIR) / (Green + NIR)$\n",
    "* Modified NDWI (mNDWI)\n",
    "    * $mNDWI = (Green - SWIR) / (Green + SWIR)$\n",
    "* Uses local operations to enhance water features in satellite imagery\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Composite Image\n",
    "* Combining multiple single-band raster maps into a single multi-band map\n",
    "* Each band represents a different wavelength of light\n",
    "* A local operation where the output is a multi-valued map\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating Rainfall Map using Elevation\n",
    "* Relationship: $Rainfall = f(Elevation)$\n",
    "* If a mathematical model exists (e.g., regression: $R = 0.5 \\times Elev + 100$), it can be applied as a local operation to the elevation map\n",
    "\n",
    "## Local Operations with Vector Features\n",
    "* Calculating new attributes based on existing ones\n",
    "* Example: Population Density = Population / Area\n",
    "* Area is a geometric attribute of the MU itself\n",
    "\n",
    "## Effective Local Neighborhood\n",
    "* In a local operation, the \"neighborhood\" is the MU itself\n",
    "* The operation only looks at the data within that specific unit to produce an output for that same unit\n",
    "\n",
    "## Characterizing Effective Local Neighborhood\n",
    "* Sometimes the output value depends on the geometry of the MU or the distribution of features within it\n",
    "* Local Stats: Min, Max, Mean, Sum within the MU\n",
    "* Examples:\n",
    "    * LocalSum: Sum of points within a polygon (e.g., total population in a city)\n",
    "    * LocalCount: Number of points within a polygon (e.g., number of crimes in a district)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summarize Data Toolset in ArcGIS\n",
    "* **Aggregate Points**: Local operation using polygon MUs to count points within them\n",
    "* **Summarize Within**: Local operation calculating statistics for features within a boundary (polygon/rectangle)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Two Types of Local Operations Summary\n",
    "* Type 1: Output MUs are the same as input MUs (Standard Map Algebra)\n",
    "* Type 2: Characterize effective local neighborhood where output MUs may be different from the input MUs (e.g., points to polygons)\n",
