    "\n",
    "## Why Care About Spatial Relationships\n",
    "* Yoneda Lemma\n",
    "    * If you want to understand a mathematical object, all of the information about that object is contained in the totality of relationships that object has with all other objects in its environment\n",
    "* We can learn a lot about a location by seeing how the location interacts with other locations\n",
    "    * May vary from location to location\n",
    "* Meta-map (a map of maps)\n",
    "    * Location -> {(location, {attributes})}\n",
    "    * Map of spatial relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "## Distance as the Proxy of Interactional Relationship\n",
    "* \"Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things.\" (Waldo Tobler, 1970)\n",
    "* Distance is used to represent the movement of matter, energy and information when the underlying physical processes are not well understood\n",
    "* Distance is the least movement cost between two locations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Distance Relationships\n",
    "* Distance to specific location(s)\n",
    "* Buffers\n",
    "* Proximity regions (Thiessen Polygons/Voronoi Diagram)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Distance to Specific Location(s)\n",
    "* Every location in a study area has a distance to a specific location\n",
    "* Examples:\n",
    "    * Distance to the coastline\n",
    "    * Distance to the nearest hospital\n",
    "    * Distance to the nearest highway\n",
    "\n",
    "## Buffers\n",
    "* A buffer is a region within a specified distance of a geographic feature\n",
    "* Buffer types:\n",
    "    * Points, lines, or polygons\n",
    "    * Fixed distance vs. variable distance\n",
    "    * Single vs. multiple rings\n",
    "\n",
    "## Proximity Regions (Voronoi Diagram)\n",
    "* Every location within a proximity region is closer to the associated generator point than to any other generator point\n",
    "* Boundaries are the perpendicular bisectors of the lines connecting neighboring points\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Calculating Distance\n",
    "* Movement cost in different space/media\n",

    "\n",
    "## Euclidean Distance\n",
    "* $d_{ij} = \\sqrt{(x_i - x_j)^2 + (y_i - y_j)^2}$\n",
    "* Straight line distance in a flat plane (PCS)\n",

    "* Calculated using latitude and longitude (GCS)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Network Distance\n",
    "* Distance is constrained by a network of interconnected lines (links) and points (nodes)\n",
    "* Shortest path algorithm (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm)\n",
    "* Examples: travel time, fuel consumption\n",
    "\n",
    "## Distance on a Friction Surface\n",
    "* Movement cost varies across space due to different \"friction\" or \"impedance\"\n",
    "* Cost Surface/Friction Surface:\n",
    "    * A raster map where each cell represents the cost of moving across it\n",
    "* Least Cost Path:\n",
    "    * The path between two locations that minimizes the cumulative cost\n",

    "    * A map showing the minimum cost to reach a source from any location\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Isotropic vs. Anisotropic Friction\n",
    "* Isotropic: Cost is the same regardless of the direction of movement (e.g., land cover)\n",
    "* Anisotropic: Cost depends on the direction of movement (e.g., wind, slope/terrain)\n",
