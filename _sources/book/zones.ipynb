    "\n",
    "## Map Compute Framework\n",
    "* Operations:\n",
    "    * Local, focal, and global operations based on the spatial scope of neighborhood\n",
    "    * Neighborhood relation operations\n",
    "* 3 kinds of mapping/analysis units:\n",
    "    * Cells, raster zones, vector features\n",

    "* Raster zones as mapping units\n",
    "    * Local, focal, and global operations\n",
    "* Raster zones as neighborhoods\n",
    "    * Zonal neighborhoods\n",
    "\n",
    "## Raster Zones\n",
    "* A raster zone consists of a set of cells with the same condition/attribute or entity/identity.\n",
    "* Acts as one of the 3 mapping units of a map (alongside cells and features).\n",
    "* Often a raster representation of vector features obtained by vector-to-raster conversion.\n",
    "* Examples include land cover types, soil types, or administrative boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Raster Zones as Mapping Units\n",
    "* A map can be viewed as a function where the domain is a set of zones.\n",
    "* Each zone has one or more attribute values.\n",
    "* In ArcGIS, this is typically represented by a Raster Attribute Table (RAT).\n",

    "## Local Operations with Raster Zones\n",
    "* Characterize attributes of the cells within each zone.\n",
    "* The neighborhood is the zone itself.\n",
    "* Operations include:\n",
    "    * ReduceSum: Total value of cells in the zone.\n",
    "    * ReduceMean: Average value of cells in the zone.\n",
    "    * ReduceMax / ReduceMin: Extreme values in the zone.\n",
    "    * ReduceVariety: Number of unique values in the zone.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Focal Operations with Raster Zones\n",
    "* Modeling interactional relationships between zones.\n",
    "* Requires a neighborhood relationship between zones, such as adjacency or distance.\n",
    "* The output value for a zone depends on the attributes of its neighboring zones.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Global Operations with Raster Zones\n",
    "* The output value for a zone depends on all other zones in the map.\n",
    "* Examples include ranking zones by total area or mean elevation relative to the entire study area.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Raster Zones as Zonal Neighborhoods\n",
    "* A zone can define a neighborhood for the cells it contains.\n",
    "* Every cell within the same zone shares the same zonal neighborhood.\n",
    "* This is a special type of focal neighborhood where the focus cell's neighborhood is the entire zone it belongs to.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Zonal Operations in Map Algebra (MA)\n",
    "* In Tomlin's Map Algebra, Zonal Operations are a distinct category.\n",
    "* Requires two input rasters:\n",
    "    1. Zone Layer: Defines the boundaries.\n",
    "    2. Value Layer: Provides the data to be processed.\n",
    "* Common tools: ZonalMean, ZonalSum, ZonalMaximum.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Zonal Operations in the Map Compute Framework (MCF)\n",
    "* The MCF seeks simplicity by removing Zonal Operations as a separate category (applying Occam's Razor).\n",
    "* They are treated instead as:\n",
    "    1. Local operations with zones as MUs (summarizing a zone).\n",
    "    2. Focal operations with zonal neighborhoods (assigning zonal data back to cells).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Map Algebra vs. Map Compute Framework\n",
    "* Zonal operations in MA are grouped by spatial scope.\n",
    "* In MCF, local operations with zonal mapping units are more efficient for summarizing, while focal operations with zonal neighborhoods allow for contrasting focus cells with their surrounding zone.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Operation Type | Map Algebra (MA) | Map Compute Framework (MCF) |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| Summarize Zone | Zonal Statistics | Local (Zone as MU) |\n",
    "| Zone-based Focal | Sub-zone operations | Focal (Zonal Neighborhood) |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary: Parity and Parsimony\n",
    "* Occam's Razor: The MCF uses the smallest set of elements to explain spatial analysis.\n",
    "* Zonal operations are redundant because they can be described using local or focal definitions.\n",
    "* This framework allows for additional possibilities, such as global operations applied specifically to zonal mapping units.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Map Algebra vs Map Compute\n",
    "* Zonal operations in Map Algebra (MA)\n",
    "    * Raster operations are grouped as local, focal, and zonal according to the spatial scope of the operations.\n",
    "* Equivalent operations in Map Compute Framework (MCF)\n",
    "    * Local operations with zonal mapping units: Zone raster defines the MUs.\n",
    "    * Focal operations with zonal neighborhoods: Zone raster defines and stores zonal neighborhoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "## No Zonal Operations in MCF\n",
    "* Occam's (or Ockham's) razor\n",
    "    * Principle that searches for explanations constructed with the smallest possible set of elements.\n",
    "    * It is also known as the principle of parsimony or the law of parsimony.\n",
    "* No zonal operations in MCF\n",
    "    * Zonal operations can be performed using local operations with raster zones as MUs or focal operations with zonal neighborhoods (a special neighborhood).\n",
    "* Additional operations (compared with MA)\n",
    "    * Focal and global operations with zonal MUs.\n",
    "    * Neighborhood relation operations with zonal neighborhoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ArcGIS Zonal Toolset\n",
    "* Local operations with raster zone MUs\n",
    "    * Zonal geometry, histogram, statistics.\n",
    "    * Zonal fill: Finds the minimum value on a zone's edge (LocalReduce operation using both location/edge and value).\n",
    "    * Tabulate area: LocalCombine operation.\n",
    "* Zone as neighborhoods\n",
    "    * These are not explicitly implemented as focal operations in ArcGIS.\n",
    "    * Block statistics tools provide some functional overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Siren Population Coverage Analysis Example\n",
    "* Problem: Determine the population covered by emergency sirens (5800 feet range).\n",
    "* Approach: Compare vector vs. raster data models for this spatial analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Siren Population Coverage Analysis in Vector Data Model\n",
    "* Circle neighborhood: A buffer is created for each siren point.\n",
    "* Neighborhood relation operation (NbrLocation):\n",
    "    * Combine all the individual circle neighborhoods together into a single multi-part coverage polygon.\n",
    "* Effective neighbors:\n",
    "    * Intersect the coverage polygon with census blocks to identify the overlapping areas.\n",
    "* Local sum:\n",
    "    * Sum the population from the effective neighbor census blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Population Coverage Analysis in Vector (ArcGIS Workflows)\n",
    "* Workflow A (Manual steps):\n",
    "    1. Generate and dissolve buffers.\n",
    "    2. Intersect dissolved buffers with census blocks to get effective neighbors.\n",
    "    3. Calculate effective neighbor population.\n",
    "    4. Sum effective neighbor population.\n",
    "* Workflow B (Automated tool):\n",
    "    * Summarize Within: Performs these steps automatically under the hood.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Calculate Siren Zone Raster Layer\n",
    "* Each siren point or cell has a 5800 feet neighborhood.\n",
    "* Neighborhood relation operation (NbrLocation):\n",
    "    * Combines all the cells within any neighborhood to define a single raster zone representing the Coverage Area.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Vector vs Raster Analysis Summary\n",
    "* Raster analysis:\n",
    "    * Applies an arbitrary spatial resolution.\n",
    "    * Requires choosing an appropriate cell size to balance processing time and accuracy.\n",
    "    * Risk of missing small polygons if the cell size is too large.\n",
    "* Vector analysis:\n",
    "    * Performs analysis at the original data resolution.\n",
    "* MCF Unified Approach:\n",
    "    * Provides the same conceptual workflow and operations regardless of whether a vector or raster data model is used."
