    "\n",
    "Topics\n",
    "* Randomness of point location\n",
    "* Quadrat analysis\n",
    "* Nearest neighbor analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Descriptive Spatial Statistics\n",
    "* Where is the center of a geographic distribution\n",
    "    * Mean center\n",
    "* How features are distributed around its center\n",
    "    * Standard distance\n",
    "    * Standard deviation ellipse\n",
    "\n",

    "## Point Randomness\n",
    "* Characterizing the randomness of a set of points in space\n",
    "    * Random\n",
    "    * Uniform (Dispersed)\n",
    "    * Clustered\n",

    "## Point Pattern Randomness Analysis\n",
    "* Analysis on forms helps understand the processes that produced the patterns.\n",
    "* Clustered patterns:\n",
    "    * Contagion process where a particular location attracts a number of points.\n",
    "* Dispersed/uniform patterns:\n",
    "    * Some form of competition in space where points repel one another.\n",
    "* Random patterns:\n",
    "    * Results of random processes.\n",
    "    * Any point is equally likely to occur at any location.\n",
    "    * The position of any point is not affected by the position of any other point.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quadrat Analysis\n",
    "* Initially developed by ecologists studying the spatial distribution of plants.\n",
    "* A regular grid is overlain over the region of interest.\n",
    "* The number of points in each quadrat is recorded.\n",
    "* The observed number of points per quadrat is compared with the theoretical distribution generated by a complete spatial random (CSR) process.\n",
    "* If the observed and theoretical distributions are similar, then the observed distribution could be generated by a random process.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Observed vs. Random Distribution\n",
    "* For a random process, the probability of finding k points in a quadrat follows the Poisson distribution.\n",
    "* $P(k) = \\frac{\\lambda^k e^{-\\lambda}}{k!}$\n",
    "    * $\\lambda$ = intensity (total points / total quadrats).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variance-Mean Ratio (VMR)\n",
    "* A common way to describe the pattern in quadrat analysis.\n",
    "* For a Poisson (random) distribution, the variance equals the mean ($VMR = 1$).\n",
    "* Clustered pattern:\n",
    "    * Many quadrats with 0 points and few with many points.\n",
    "    * Variance is greater than the mean ($VMR > 1$).\n",
    "* Uniform pattern:\n",
    "    * Most quadrats have a similar number of points.\n",
    "    * Variance is less than the mean ($VMR < 1$).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Issues with Quadrat Analysis\n",
    "* Result depends on quadrat size and orientation.\n",
    "* A measure of dispersion (VMR) is not a measure of the actual point locations within quadrats.\n",
    "* Small sample size issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Nearest Neighbor Analysis\n",
    "* Developed by Clark and Evans (1954).\n",
    "* Uses the distance between a point and its nearest neighbor to characterize the pattern.\n",
    "* Provides a more refined measure than quadrat analysis because it uses the actual coordinates of every point.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Nearest Neighbor Index (NNI)\n",
    "* $NNI = \\frac{d(NN)}{d(random)}$\n",
    "* $d(NN)$: The average observed distance between each point and its nearest neighbor.\n",
    "* $d(random)$: The expected average distance if the pattern were random.\n",
    "    * $d(random) = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{\\rho}}$ (where $\\rho$ is the density of points).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interpreting NNI\n",
    "* $NNI = 1$: The pattern is random.\n",
    "* $NNI < 1$: The pattern is clustered (observed distances are shorter than random).\n",
    "* $NNI > 1$: The pattern is dispersed/uniform (observed distances are longer than random).\n",
    "    * Maximum $NNI = 2.149$ (perfectly hexagonal/uniform distribution).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Significance Test for NNI\n",
    "* Clark and Evans proposed a Z-test for significance.\n",
    "* $Z = \\frac{d(NN) - d(random)}{SE}$\n",
    "    * $SE$ is the standard error of the random distance.\n",
    "* Null Hypothesis: The distribution is from a random distribution.\n",
    "* If the Z-value is outside the critical range (-1.96 to 1.96 for a 0.05 confidence level), the null hypothesis is rejected.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comparison: Quadrat Analysis vs. Nearest Neighbor\n",
    "* Nearest Neighbor:\n",
    "    * No quadrat size problem to be concerned with.\n",
    "    * Uses exact locations.\n",
    "* Both methods:\n",
    "    * Still have the issue of the study area boundary (the \"edge effect\").\n",
    "    * Points near the edge might have a nearest neighbor outside the study area that is not counted."
