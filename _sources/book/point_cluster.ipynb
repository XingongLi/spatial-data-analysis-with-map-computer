    "# Point Pattern Analysis: Clusters\n",
    "\n",
    "Topics:\n",
    "* Mapping point clusters\n",
    "* Clustering points\n",
    "\n",
    "## Point Randomness\n",
    "* Characterizing the overall point pattern (randomness):\n",
    "    * Random\n",
    "    * Uniform (Dispersed)\n",
    "    * Clustered\n",
    "\n",
    "## Locate Clusters\n",
    "* Knowing that a point distribution is clustered does not necessarily give information about where the clusters reside.\n",
    "* Mapping clusters:\n",
    "    * Calculate spatial variation of point density.\n",
    "    * Useful if points are samples.\n",
    "* Clustering points:\n",
    "    * Identify specific points that are close to each other.\n",
    "    * Useful if points are the \"population.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mapping Clusters (Kernel Estimation)\n",
    "* Areas of high point density indicate clusters.\n",
    "* Naïve point density mapping:\n",
    "    * Use a regular grid in space.\n",
    "    * Calculate the density of points within a circular neighborhood at each grid center.\n",
    "    * $Density = Number\\ of\\ points / \\pi d^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)\n",
    "* A focal operation where weights are defined by a continuous kernel function.\n",
    "* The weight is highest at the center (focus) and decreases to zero at the neighborhood boundary (bandwidth).\n",
    "* Provides a smoother surface than naïve density mapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Issues with KDE\n",
    "* Choice of bandwidth (radius) significantly impacts the result.\n",
    "    * Small bandwidth: Shows local variation and noise.\n",
    "    * Large bandwidth: Shows broad trends but hides local clusters.\n",
    "* Choice of kernel function (e.g., Quartic, Gaussian) has less impact than bandwidth.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Clustering Points\n",
    "* Grouping points into categories based on spatial proximity.\n",
    "* Goal: Find groups of points that are \"closer\" to each other than to points outside the group.\n",
    "\n",
    "## K-Means Clustering\n",
    "* Partitions $n$ points into $k$ clusters.\n",
    "* Procedure:\n",
    "    1. Randomly select $k$ points as initial cluster centers (centroids).\n",
    "    2. Assign each point to the nearest centroid.\n",
    "    3. Re-calculate the centroids of the new clusters.\n",
    "    4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until centroids no longer move significantly.\n",
    "* Issue: You must specify the number of clusters ($k$) in advance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Density-Based Spatial Clustering (DBSCAN)\n",
    "* Classifies points into three categories:\n",
    "    * Cores: Points inside a cluster with at least $m-1$ points within distance $r$.\n",
    "    * Borders: Points inside a cluster but with fewer than $m-1$ points within distance $r$.\n",
    "    * Noise: Points not belonging to any cluster.\n",
    "* Does not require specifying the number of clusters in advance.\n",
    "* Can identify clusters of arbitrary shapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## DBSCAN in the Map Compute Framework (MCF)\n",
    "* Viewed as a series of Neighborhood Relation and Graph operations.\n",
    "* Step 1: NbrGraph (Neighborhood relation operation)\n",
    "    * Create a distance-based neighborhood ($r$).\n",
    "    * Form a graph where points are nodes and proximity forms links.\n",
    "* Step 2: Graph Analysis\n",
    "    * Identify sub-graphs (connected components).\n",
    "    * Classify sub-graphs based on the number of points ($m$).\n",
    "* Step 3: Node Classification\n",
    "    * Nodes in small sub-graphs ($< m$) are noise.\n",
    "    * Nodes in large sub-graphs ($\\ge m$) are core or border based on their degree (number of links).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary: Mapping vs. Clustering\n",
    "* Mapping (KDE) results in a continuous surface (raster) showing the intensity of events.\n",
    "* Clustering (DBSCAN, K-Means) results in categorical assignments (attributes) for the original point features.\n",
    "* Choice of method depends on whether you want to visualize a \"heat map\" or identify distinct groups for further analysis."
